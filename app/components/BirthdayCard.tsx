  Happy birthday, Talha, my Prince, my Love! Today is the day we celebrate the most amazing person. I hope your day is filled with love, laughter, and all your favorite things.

  As I sit down to write this letter to you, I&apos;m overwhelmed with emotions. I don&apos;t even know where to begin. From the moment we met in class, I knew there was something special about you. You&apos;re always in a serious mood, but the first time I saw your bright smile, I loved it. Always keep that smile on your face.

  Over the past three years, our friendship has grown into something much more. We&apos;ve shared countless memories, from late-night study sessions to deep conversations. You&apos;re the one person who truly loves me, and I love how we can always count on each other. Whether it&apos;s for help with assignments and university projects (hahah), or just chatting about life, you&apos;re always there for me. Thank you. Your support means the world to me. You have this amazing ability to make me laugh, even on my worst days.

  It&apos;s the little things, too. As we celebrate another year of life, I want to say thank you. Thank you for being my partner and my best friend. Thank you for making every day brighter just by being with me. Thank you for being you, Talha. I love you for who you are.

  As we look to the future, I know there will be ups and downs, challenges, and obstacles. But I&apos;m ready to face them all with you by my side. I&apos;m ready to take on the world with you.

  So here&apos;s to many more adventures, laughter, and memories to be created together! Here&apos;s to many more late-night conversations, arguments, and deep talks. Here&apos;s to many more years of love, happiness, and growth together.

  Happy birthday, my love! I love you more than words can express.
</p>
